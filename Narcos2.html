						<p> "Narcos" is a television series developed by Netflix that focuses on the true story of a perilous spread and propagation of a cocaine network throughout the world during the 70's and 80's. However, the security forces will face this brutal and shocking conflict. The series is narrated in voice-over from the present while telling the story of the battle between Escobar and the Medellin Cartel against the Colombian government supported by Washington.</p>

						<p>This dramatic fiction follows one of Colombia's most important cocaine kingpins, Pablo Escobar. On the other hand, Javier Peña, a Mexican DEA agent, is sent to the location to capture the dangerous leader and annihilate him. The series stars Wagner Moura, Pedro Pascal, Boyd Holdbrook, Manolo Cardona and Juan Pablo Raba, among others.</p>
						
						<p>Produced by Gaumont International Television in conjunction with Netflix and written by Chris Brancato, 'Narcos' features Eric Newman and José Padilha as executive producers and the latter also as director.</p>

						Seasons
				</h1>
				</p>

					<ul>

						<p>First season: Pablo Escobar is the most famous drug lord in all of Colombia. The threat he poses rises to a global scale so the United States decides to act. The American country sends Steve Murphy, a DEA agent who moves to Colombia with the company of his wife and unmarried daughter.

                            Once here, Murphy joins forces with agent Javier Peña, also a DEA agent who has been in Colombia for some time. Together they embark on a quest to bring Escobar down, while also fighting corruption, threats and all kinds of heinous acts.</p>

						<p>Second season: The police fight against Pablo Escobar continues to move forward and becomes more intense and relevant for each of the opponents. Escobar, having retreated, sees his way of life threatened and, like an animal in peril, becomes more dangerous, taking more cautious decisions with a clear message to the government and to all those who oppose him.

                            Murphy and Peña, for their part, are horrified by what is happening and wonder whether the best decision is to prevent further evil or to hunt down the notorious criminal.</p>

						<p>Third season: Pablo Escobar is dead, but the danger of the traffickers is more alive than ever. With the fall of Escobar, the Cali Cartel has taken a step forward, establishing itself as the most prominent drug trafficking organization in Colombia, and with expectations of expansion into the United States.

                            Now without Murphy, Javier Peña takes a leading role in the search. The United States decides to give him back his police badge and badge on the condition that he takes the lead in the Cali case. Peña accepts and dives into a game in which there is a powerful opponent.</p>
