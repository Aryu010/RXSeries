					<ul>
						<p>Peaky Blinders is a BBC drama that tells the story of the gypsy family Shelby and their gang of gangsters, a group of people who are known for their shiny berets and ownership of illegal businesses, who dominate the underground gambling industry and are rewarded through extortion.</p>

						<p>The story begins in Birmingham (the United Kingdom) in the 1920s when a young Tomas (Tommy) Shelby returns from the war after fighting against the French to take over the family business run, during his absence, by his aunt Polly Gray.</p>

						<p>However, once he arrives back home, there are problems. Running a criminal business is no easy task, especially if the psychological scars of being at war are still present. In addition, political disagreements create a rift between his best childhood friend Freddie, with communist ideas, and his sister Ada, who maintain a relationship far away from the family and, above all, from Tommy.</p>
						<p>The disputes also appear in the field of the professional, because he has several encounters with different enemies, the most important being a new police captain from Belfast who has proposed to clean the place of criminals, gangsters and anyone who is against the laws that the country dictates, his main task being to recover some weapons intercepted by Shelby.</p>
						<p>Peaky Blinders stars Cillian Murphy, star of Llums vermelles; and Sam Neill (Pla de Fuita). In addition, the creator and screenwriter of the series is none other than Steven Knight, creator of the story of Promises of the East.</p>
