						Seasons
				</h1>
				</p>

					<ul>

						<p>First season: The first season of the series begins when Samuel, Nadia and Christian obtain a scholarship in the exclusive private institute Les Alzines. This seems like a normal thing, except that these three young people, who belong to the working class, have the scholarship because in their old school the support is going to disappear. The inequalities between them and the rich students give rise to various problems that end with an assassination.</p>

						<p>Second season: After Marina's death and that Nano was unjustly blamed for her murder, Samuel will try to get his brother out of prison in the new course at Les Alzines. Sex, drugs, parties and another mystery are the protagonists of this new season with new students: Valerio, Cayetana and Rebeca.</p>

						<p>Third season: After Polo's return to the Alzines, all the students are in tension and it can only end in one way: with a new tragedy at the Institute: the death of Pol himself. While they are going through the last months at the institute, the protagonists have to deal with love, sex and friendship, but also with jealousy, secrets and the desire for revenge in a journey that threatens to destroy a life that in reality was just about to begin.</p>

						<p>Fourth season: After the death of Polo and the departure of Carla, Dl. and Nadia, Les Alzines opens its doors to start the new course.
                       				 Samu, Guzman, Rebeka and Ander become seniors and they are joined by Omar who enters as a new student at the institute, while Cayetana has become the girlfriend of the net.
						 Now, more together than ever, but always apart, they live with a new generation of students who are not quite out of the youngsters' plans. But the appearance of four of our students, Ari, Patrick, Mencia and Phillipe, will allow them to link their lives.</p>

						<p>Fifth season: After it is discovered that Ari was attacked by Armando and that he was killed by Guzmán, Rebe and Samuel decide to save his life by hiding his body in the bottom of the lake. But they have to keep one more secret.

                        Guzmán can't cope with what he has done, so he decides to travel around the world with Ander, leaving Cayetana, Rebe, Omar and Samuel behind. On the other hand, Ari is still recovering from his injuries while he accepts that he really loves Samuel.

                        But the protagonists could not be more wrong if they think that the next course will be much calmer, especially with the entry of two new students who promise, once again, to revolutionize Les Alzines.</p>
						
						<p>Season six: Samuel's destiny after Benjamí's empenyés and his head is still hanging by a thread. On the other hand, Omar and Rebe don't want to know anything about Benjamí's family and Iván decides to return to Patrick after he comes clean with his father Cruz.
