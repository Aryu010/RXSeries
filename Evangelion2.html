						<p> It has been 15 years since contact was made in 2000 with mysterious beings known as angels. As a result, the so-called Second Impact occurred, a worldwide cataclysm caused by an explosion in Antarctica that halved the human population on Earth. To prevent future attacks, the UN set up the NERV organization in Tokyo-3, which has been developing Evangelions, huge biomechanical creatures piloted by teenagers that are the only thing that can stop the angels.</p>
						<p> We are currently in 2015 focusing on a young man, Shinji Ikari. Hoping to win the affection of his father, the leader of NERV, the teenager accepts his orders and decides to pilot the Evangelion unit 01 (Eva-01) in order to finish off the Third Angel. From that moment on, Shinji's life changes forever as he settles in the city and tries to become an elite pilot.</p>

						Seasons

					<ul>

						<p>Season One: In 2015, the Angels, huge and extremely powerful alien war machines, appear for the second time on Earth. The only hope for the survival of Humanity lies in the Evangelion, a humanoid fighting robot developed by NERV, a special agency of the United Nations. Able to withstand any attack from the Angels, the Evangelion's only problem is that very few people are able to pilot it. Only a group of young people are able to communicate with them, all of them born 14 years and 9 months after the first appearance of the Angels. One of these young men is Shinji Ikari, whose father is the NERV leader of the team that developed and maintains the Evangelion. Thrown into a whirlpool of battles and successes he doesn't understand, Shinji is forced to search within himself for the courage and strength to not only fight, but to survive in the face of the risk of losing everything.</p>
