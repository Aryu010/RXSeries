						<p>Highly acclaimed by critics, this television drama written and produced by Vince Gilligan ('The X-Files') shows the life of Walter White (Bryan Cranston 'Malcolm'), a genius in the field of chemistry whose existence is marked by enormous frustration both at a personal and professional level.</p>

						<p>Embittered by a monotonous and dull relationship with his wife and unable to prove his brilliance by working as a high school teacher, Walter takes a radical turn in his way of life when he discovers that he has terminal cancer. From then on, in his own way, he decides to reaffirm his love for his family and for chemistry by setting up a methamphetamine lab alongside Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), an old and troubled student, in order to leave his wife and son in good stead when he is gone.</p>

						<p>The series explores the limits of being human and exposes Walter to situations he could never have imagined being in. For a long time, the series shows this chemistry professor finding himself in these kinds of situations, which takes him straight back to his former lifestyle. No va, the most accurate translation of the original title of the series is: Badly remembering</p>
