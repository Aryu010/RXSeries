						<p>The series is set in the 9th century when what is now known as England was made up of several independent kingdoms. The Anglo-Saxon lands are attacked and in many cases ruled by Viking forces. The kingdom of Wessex was left under the command of King Alfred the Great. Uhtred, the golden son of a Saxon nobleman, is sequestered by the Normans and raised as one of them. Thus, he is forced to choose between a kingdom that shares his ancestors and the people to whom he is loyal.</p>

						<p>First season: It is the year 872, almost all the kingdoms that we now know as England have been conquered by the Vikings, only the great kingdom of Wessex under the command of King Alfred the Great remains impregnable and defiant. In this turbulent context lives Uhtred. After his parents, noble Saxons, were killed by the invaders, he was captured and raised as one of them. Forced to choose between his origins and the people he grew up with, his loyalty will always be put to the test. What is he? A saxophone or a viking? In his quest to reclaim his birthright, Uhtred will have to travel a perilous path between the two sides.</p>

						<p>Second season: Uhtread tries to overcome his grief after the murder of a loved one. The only way in which he is able to overcome this is thanks to Hild, the nun he rescued from the Danish siege, for which she helps him to get up, turns his back and reminds him that he is Uhtred, Uhtred's son and that he has a birthright that he has to claim. Back in Winchester, King Alfred enjoys the success he had in the battle of Ethandun, for which reason, taking advantage of his recent fame, he tries to claim more lands under his name. Uhtred manages to infiltrate Sigefried and Erik's camp to assassinate them, but instead he carves Sigefrid's hand, turning him into his enemy and threatening Erik to end his mission if they don't both leave England. As the season progresses, Uhtred achieves a state of peace for three years, living with Gisela in Cookman and his son, but when a familiar face arrives at his home to inform him of a prophecy in which Uhtred is destined to become King, he embarks on a war to reclaim what is rightfully his.</p>

Alfred wants to protect his arrival and reunite the kingdoms of the country, however, the Danes continue to interrupt their plans provoking numerous attacks on the kingdom. The king's health continues to worsen so he asks for Uhtred's help to complete his mission, however, the warrior's origin causes a series of internal conflicts that threaten the success of his goal, moreover, the appearance of a witch and a bloodthirsty assassin further complicate the task.

After Edward's name has been put on the table to become King Alfred's successor, Aethelwold does everything possible to take the crown before his son is officially named. His ambition leads him to kill Ragnar in his sleep. Meanwhile, Edward leads his father's forces in the first battle against the Danes. He achieves a victory for Wessex against Heasten's forces.
