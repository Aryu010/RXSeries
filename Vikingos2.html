					<ul>
						<p>This new History Channel historical drama is centered on Ragnar Lothbrok, a mythical figure who claimed to be the descendant of Odin, the main god of Norse mythology.</p>

						<p>In it, Ragnar Lothbrok has a dream, which is to explore new civilizations by sailing the seas. Thanks to the help of his friend Floki, a buffoon, they build new, faster and more elegant ships with which to give shape to their greatest dream. In their adventure they meet Earl Haraldson, Gabriel Byrne, their main enemy, who is suspicious of Lothbrok's expectations. The fight between them is not long in coming.</p>

						<p> Lothbrok manages to become the best warrior of the Viking tribe as he struggles to become the king of Denmark and much of what is now Sweden. The series highlights the most imaginative battles, with more emphasis on the individual points of view, strategies and cunning of the characters.</p>
